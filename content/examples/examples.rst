Here, we consider the forward modeling and inversion of DIGHEM-style data, collected over a 3-layered Earth model. Data were collected at 5 frequencies for a single sounding. The inversion was performed using algorithm 2 (:ref:`discrepancy principal<theory_inversion_disc>`) and set to recover a conductivity model and a positive susceptibility model (:ref:`mtype = 3<invL3>`).
