Elements of the program
=======================


The program library consists of the programs:

#. **em1dfm**: performs the inversion.

#. **em1dfmfwd**: performs forward modeling.

Each of the above programs requires input files and the specification of parameters in order to run. However, some files are used by a number of programs. Before detailing the procedures for running each of the above programs, we first present information about these general files.
